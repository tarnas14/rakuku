# Welcome to Voucherify Webhooks Example

---

This example shows how Voucherify Webhooks in action.

You can see for yourself how easy it is to receive the webhooks - just one quick configuration option in the Voucherify project settings and you are good to go. Please be aware webhooks are sent asynchronously, so you may experience a delay of up to 30s, depending on Voucherify server load.

## Using this repository

You can browse the code (and quickly spin up your own rendition of this example) [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/voucherify-webhooks-example) and see a working live example at [https://voucherify-webhooks-example.glitch.me/](https://voucherify-webhooks-example.glitch.me/).

You will find usages of `distributions` and `redemptions` namespaces of [voucherify package](https://github.com/voucherifyio/voucherify-nodejs-sdk). This is more convenient than hitting the API endpoints directly, the voucherfiy client does all the groundwork of constructing REST requests for you!
